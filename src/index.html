        <summary>No dependencies and no surprises</summary>
        <p>
          This page contains information about the services we offer. It doubles
          as a place to check our CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is simple because we didn't want to spend time designing it. It is
          written in semantic, valid HTML, and styled using a small amount of
          CSS. We don't use JavaScript to create pages but we do use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We find browser defaults to be mostly acceptable so we don't spend our
          time and your resources on a CSS reset stylesheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't like to be indebted to a bunch of dependencies but we do like
          to run tests, and to check our code using linters. If our developer
          dependencies become a burden to maintain, we will remove or replace
          them. CSS preprocessors and TypeScript can be useful on larger
          projects but they are not merited here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we don't use a framework or libraries, there are no client
          side dependencies. Our pages are therefore light.
